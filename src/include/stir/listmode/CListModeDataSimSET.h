  \ingroup listmode SimSET
  \brief Declaration of class stir::CListModeDataSimSET

  \details This class tries to read the PHG param file, which is the
  same used to run the SimSET simulation. However, it will then check for a
  history file and initialise an InputStream.

  Unfortuantely, SimSET does not hold any information on the scanner; as name,
  model, manufacurer etc. In addition, in the case of cylindrical PET scanner
  important information as number of detectors and rings might not be present.

  THerefore in order to detect the scanner we try to harvest as much information
  as possible and compare it with the templates in Scanner.cxx.
  Scanner not included in that file will not be able to operate.

  The important bits of infomation are the number of rings, inner ring radius,
  number of detectors, number of layers and number of bins. Optionally, energy resolution.

  If two scanners share those same characteristics, the first one in order will
  be used.
  The number of rings might come from two sources. First is checked if the
  cylindrical ring geometry was separated in rings. In SimSET that is not
  mandatory.

  If that is the case, we will chack the bining parameters file.
  You can set the Z binning to be the number of rings.
  
  If the cylinder was separated in rings then, in SimSET each gap is defined
  as a ring of air. Therefore most likely the simulation will have 2N + 1 and that
  is the number with which we will be checking.

  Although the cylinder might be separated in rings, radial gaps on the cylinder
  are not defined in some way. In order to let STIR know the number of detectors per
  ring you have to set in binning parameter file the number of tagential positions
  to be half the number of detectors.

  Moreover, the the inner ring is taken by the LayerInfo->InnerRadius,

  \warning C\urrectly, we support only simplePET and cylindrical scanners.
